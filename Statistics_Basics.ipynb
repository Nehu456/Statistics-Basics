        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Random sampling ensures that every individual in a population has an equal chance of being selected. This helps avoid bias, where certain individuals or groups within the population are more likely to be chosen than others. By making sure the sample is representative of the broader population, random sampling allows for generalizations that are more likely to reflect the true characteristics of the entire population.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. Minimizes Bias:**\n",
        "\n",
        "If a sample is chosen in a non-random manner (e.g., only selecting people from a specific group or location), the results could be skewed and not truly represent the population. Random sampling eliminates this risk, as it ensures that the sample is spread across all parts of the population without preconceptions or preferences.\n",

With random sampling, the sample data can be used to estimate population parameters (e.g., population mean, population proportion). These estimates can then be accompanied by measures of uncertainty (e.g., confidence intervals) to quantify how much the sample may differ from the population.\n",

By assuming randomness, researchers can apply various statistical models (like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, etc.) and calculate the probability of observing certain results in the population. This allows researchers to make more accurate and reliable conclusions.\n",

Random sampling helps reduce the impact of this variability by ensuring that the sample, on average, mirrors the diversity of the population.

It is particularly useful in situations where the trials are Bernoulli trials. Here are the key conditions under which the binomial distribution is applied:\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The normal distribution is one of the most important probability distributions in statistics because of its widespread applicability in modeling natural phenomena and measurement errors. The normal distribution is also known as the Gaussian distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are the key properties of the normal distribution:\n",
        "\n",
        "Symmetry:\n",
        "\n",
        "The normal distribution is symmetric about its mean. This means that the left and right sides of the distribution are mirror images of each other.\n",
        "The mean, median, and mode of a normal distribution are all equal and lie at the center of the distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Bell-shaped Curve:\n",
        "\n",
        "The graph of a normal distribution forms a bell-shaped curve, where most of the data points cluster around the mean, and the frequency of observations decreases as you move away from the center.\n",
        "The tails of the distribution extend infinitely in both directions but approach the horizontal axis asymptotically (they never touch the axis).\n",
        "\n",
        "68-95-99.7 Rule (Empirical Rule): The normal distribution follows a pattern that describes the proportion of data within certain intervals from the mean. This is known as the empirical rule or 68-95-99.7 rule.\n",
        "\n",
        "Asymptotic Tails:\n",
        "\n",
        "The tails of the normal distribution curve extend infinitely in both directions and get closer to the horizontal axis but never actually touch it. This means that extreme values (very far from the mean) are possible, but their probability is very low.\n"

        "Real-life Example of a Poisson Process:\n",
        "A Poisson process is used to model the occurrence of events that happen independently and at a constant average rate within a fixed interval of time or space. These events must happen randomly, without a predictable pattern, but the average rate is known.\n",

        "Imagine a customer service call center that receives phone calls from customers. The average number of calls the call center receives per hour is known to be 10 calls.\n",
